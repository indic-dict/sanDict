sanDict support 3 ways to search: <i>Glob-style pattern matching</i>, <i>Fuzzy query</i> and <i>Full-text</i> search.

Stardict dictionaries are not included in the application and should be obtained separately.

Dictionaries should be placed in <code>/sdcard/dictdata</code>. Each dictionary should be placed into a separate subfolder, for instance <code>/sdcard/QDict/dicts/dict-name</code>. It's recommended to only use alphanumeric filenames.
